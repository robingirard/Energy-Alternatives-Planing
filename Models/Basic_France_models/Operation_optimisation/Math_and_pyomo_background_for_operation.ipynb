    "**Principles of a pyomo model**\n",
    "To build a model, Pyomo needs three different kinds of data : sets, parameters and variables.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Sets* are dimensions, here the time and the name of technology plus a mix of these two :\n",
    "Date, TECHNOLOGIES and Date_TECHNOLOGIES (product set).\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Parameters* are tables indexed by set whose values are specified by the user.\n",
    "Here is the list of the parameters we use in the simplest cases : energycost, EnergyNbhourCap, capacity,\n",
    "availability factor, area consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    " - *Variable* are tables indexed by set whose values are found by the solver :\n",
    "the energy produced by each mean of production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you wish to learn more about pyomo and to see how the optimisation problem is writen in pyomo language,\n",
    "take look at function GetElectricSystemModel_GestionSingleNode  (by doing a control-click on it in the code that follos a bit later,\n",
    "otherwise it is in f_operationModels.py).\n",
    "We will use this function in the following exemple.\n",

    "If you want to give it a try, use the case_step_by_step_learning.py or case_step_by_step_learning.ipynb.\n",
    "There, we start with a simple test case, with only two production means (nuke and thermal) but you can run\n",
    "this with more than that, and change the installed power. If you want to change assumptions you will need to\n",

    "Lagrange multiplier might be more difficult to understand for those who still lack a good optimisation course (the one at second semester of first year of MINES ParisTech is perfect).\n",
    "In cases you want to dig this, you can have a look at Boyd's course, e.g. starting with [lecture 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJVmflArCXc) or before.\n",
    "The most important message here is that lagrange multipliers associated to the demand constraint (here called 'energyCtr') are meant to mimic market prices.\n",
    "Lagrange multiplier associated to this constraint at time t is the marginal cost that one would pay to increase $C_t$ by a small amount. They can be used to simulate market prices.\n",
