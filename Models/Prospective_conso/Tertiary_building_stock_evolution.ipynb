    "This document will help you understand the modeling we developed to represent a building stock (tertiary in this case) and energy retrofit pathways which can be applied to modify this initial state.\n",

    "## 2. Input data structure <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"inputdata\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "All the data input are stored in the excel file data/Hypotheses_tertiaire_1D.xlsx. There are different excel sheets in the document, each of which represents input data indexed on different variables.\n",

    "### 2.1. Global 0-Dim inputs\n",
    "In this first sheet, global 0D values are defined:\n",
    "- Initial state of the building stock: the heat need of existing buildings and the share of need due to space heating\n",
    "- Parameters of newly built buildings: the heat need of new buildings and the area of newly build buildings per year\n",
    "- Horizon parameters such as the start and end date of the simulation and the final retrofited share\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Inputs indexed by Energy-source\n",
    "Some values are indexed by the energy source, such as:\n",
    "- The initial surface heated by each energy source\n",
    "- The energy repartition by fuel, including efficiency and energy share along the year (for hybrid systems)\n",
    "\n",
